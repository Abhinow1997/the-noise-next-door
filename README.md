# The Noise Next Door

A raccoon just wants a quiet night in his tree. Then a party starts right underneath it.

He sneaks down to prank the partiers, gets chased into town wearing a camper's red beanie, becomes the neighbourhood's masked bandit, and is finally driven home, just in time for the next party. It's slapstick with no dialogue: the story is told through what the player does and how people react.

Made for CSYE 7270 (Fall 2026), Assignment 2: Generate Art, Sound, and Music for Your Game.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [CONCEPT.md](CONCEPT.md) | The one-page concept: story, core loop, pillars, art and audio direction |
| [STORYBOARD.md](STORYBOARD.md) | The whole story in 15 panels, with each panel's shot, sounds and assets |
| [design/storyboard/](design/storyboard/) | The storyboard thumbnails, and `make_thumbnails.py`, which draws them |
| `project.godot`, `main.tscn`, `raccoon_model.tscn`, `scripts/` | The Godot project |

## Run it

You need Godot 4.7.2. The project uses the Forward+ renderer.

- **Windows:** double-click `Play The Noise Next Door.bat`, or `Edit in Godot.bat` to open the editor. They look for Godot in the `GODOT` environment variable, then in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Godot`, then in your Downloads folder.
- **Anywhere:** run `godot --path .` from this folder.

**Controls:** WASD or the arrow keys to move, Shift to run, Ctrl or C to sneak, E or a click to grab or drop, Space to chitter, and the mouse wheel to zoom.

To redraw the storyboard after editing it, run `python design/storyboard/make_thumbnails.py`.

## Started from

This project started from **Raccoon Mischief**, the first prototype of this game, and it keeps building on it.

The prototype is a raccoon in a fenced garden with a five-task to-do list. Everything in it is built in GDScript when the game runs: the raccoon is a procedural low-poly model, and there are no image or sound files. It doesn't play the storyboard's story yet.

Two changes were made with Claude Code on 4 Oct 2026, before this repo existed:
- The launchers find Godot on any machine.
- The raccoon can be smoothed, using `smooth_loft()` in `scripts/lowpoly.gd` and the `smooth` setting in `scripts/raccoon_model.gd`. Turning `smooth` off brings back the original faceted look.

## Who made what

- **The author:** the prototype, the story, and the design decisions. The provenance notes at the end of CONCEPT.md and STORYBOARD.md list them.
- **Claude Code:** drafts and wording for the docs, the storyboard thumbnails (drawn in code), the two prototype changes above, and this README.
- **Generative models:** none in this repo yet. The raccoon's style target is an image generated with Google Gemini before these docs were written. It isn't in the repo yet, and it will be added with its details in the asset log.
